## Architecture Overview
The **ShopMicroservices** system is divided into multiple independent services, including:
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, and role-based access control.
- **Product Service**: Manages the product catalog, inventory, and search functionality.
- **Order Service**: Processes customer orders, payment transactions, and delivery tracking.
- **Notification Service**: Sends email or SMS notifications to users about order updates.
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks user behavior, sales, and system performance.

Each service communicates through a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to ensure asynchronous and fault-tolerant interactions.
